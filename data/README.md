This is the ThinkUp data directory. Its path is set and may be changed in config.inc.php's
$THINKUP_CFG['datadir_path'] value.

For ThinkUp to function, this directory must be read-writable by the web server user. ThinkUp automatically creates
files and folders inside this folder to store data while performing functions which require file storage.
